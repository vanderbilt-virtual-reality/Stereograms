# VR Display of the Labermeier Bassett Collection of Stereoscopic Images of Human Anatomy

Stereograms are sets of pictures that, when viewed at a specific position relative to the other picture and the viewer, appear 3-dimensional. Stereoscopy can be used across fields to showcase visuals in a more realistic way. However, the nature of stereograms requires the viewer to actually have the physical images to experience the 3D effect. While some online applications, such as Stereogranimator, allow the viewer to see the movement in the pictures that cause the images to appear 3D, the overall effect is lost. Using VR allows for viewers to see collections of stereograms as the images are meant to be seen without having to physically obtain, or even download the images. This project focuses on showcasing one collection: the Labermeier Bassett Collection of Stereoscopic Images of Human Anatomy. This collection includes very detailed anatomical images that can be interesting and useful for medical students that do not have easy access to cadavers. The dissections that medical schools use to both teach anatomy to the students and quiz their understanding require both time and money. Having these excellent images more easily available will allow medical students more opportunities to study human anatomy. The method for showcasing this collection of stereograms can also be applied to other collections, making online stereograms collections available for viewers to see in their intended format.
